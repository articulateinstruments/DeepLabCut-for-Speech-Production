Naming
------
The above folders correspond to the training set, with the exception of the folder called [`LipTest_COMBINED_TEST`](LipTest_COMBINED_TEST) which contains all test-set speakers and hand labels. 

Folders have a naming suffix of "TESTSET" if the _**speaker**_ from which the data was recorded also appears in the test-set. Not all data present here was used in training. 
There is no overlap in speakers between the training and test sets.
